Project Description:
This project aims to predict infant health status using a dataset containing behavioral data from parents. The data includes features such as parental age, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, history of diseases, accidents, surgeries, and other relevant factors. The algorithm utilized is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which is trained to classify the health status of infants into predefined categories.


1.Algorithm Used:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is implemented for classification purposes.
The model uses scikit-learn's implementation of KNN for training and prediction.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Features are normalized using StandardScaler to ensure consistency and improve model performance.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.

3.Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the predictions.
F1 Score: Balances precision and recall for a more comprehensive evaluation.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.



Steps to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Saharfatemi22/SaharFatemi-Projects.git
cd SaharFatemi-Projects/Infant-Diagnosis

Run the Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook file SAHAR-Fatemi Abhari-PROJECT ML.ipynb and execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
