Project: Store Management
The program consists of two sections: Cashier and Store Manager.
When the program runs, a login page like the one below is displayed, waiting for the user to input a username and password.

USERNAME: manager  
PASSWORD: **********
By entering the username manager and password 12345678M, the program enters the Store Manager's panel.
By entering the username cashier and password 87654321A, it enters the Cashier's panel.
Otherwise, it shows an error and waits for the user to re-enter the credentials.
In both panels, entering the command EXT exits the panel and returns to the login page.

Usernames are case-insensitive.
Passwords entered by the user should be displayed as *.
Cashier Panel
In this panel, the cashier first enters the buyer's name, followed by the name, quantity, and unit price of each item purchased by the buyer.
Finally, entering $ clears the previous information from the screen and displays the sales invoice.
After pressing any key, the program becomes ready to receive the next buyer's information.

Store Manager Panel
Entering the manager's username and password gives access to the management panel.
This panel displays statistics of all sold items regardless of the buyer's name.
